This is a list below with some code and bolds inside

- **Bold** Text with some `inline code`.
- Also with some code blocks ```const a = 5;```

End of the list.

List with numbers.
1. **Item1** This is the first list item.
2. **Item2** This is the second list item.
3. **Item3** This is the third list item.
4. **Item4** This is the fourth list item. And it also has a [LINK](#) inside.

To create a code **block** in Markdown, you would use the triple backticks (\`\`\`) with following syntax:

> \`\`\`
> let a = 5;
> console.log(a);
> a = a + 5;
> console.log(a);
> \`\`\`

The asterisk `*` creates an unordered list item, and the double asterisks `**text**` wrap the text you want to make bold. [[1]](https://aasiyaonize.hashnode.dev/markdown-and-restructured)
