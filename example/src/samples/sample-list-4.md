This is a list below with some code and bolds inside

- **Bold** Text with some `inline code`.
- Also with some code blocks ```const a = 5;```

End of the list.

List with numbers.
1. **Item1** This is the first list item.
2. **Item2** This is the second list item.
3. **Item3** This is the third list item.
4. **Item4** This is the fourth list item. And it also has a [LINK](#) inside.

Nested List with numbers.
1. **Item1** This is the first list item.
    - Test 1
    - Test 2
    - Test 3 some `inline code example (code without pre)` and right after that we want to show a real code block:
        ```javascript
        this is a block code;
        and also a new line;
        and another line;
        ```
        And after that we're still on the same 3rd level item.

2. **Item2** This is the second list item.
3. **Item3** This is the third list item.
4. **Item4** This is the fourth list item. And it also has a [LINK](#) inside.

To create a code **block** in Markdown, you would use the triple backticks (\`\`\`) with following syntax:

> \`\`\`
> let a = 5;
> console.log(a);
> a = a + 5;
> console.log(a);
> \`\`\`

The asterisk `*` creates an unordered list item, and the double asterisks `**text**` wrap the text you want to make bold. [[1]](https://aasiyaonize.hashnode.dev/markdown-and-restructured)
