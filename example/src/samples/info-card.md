Automated code review allowing developers to identify and resolve code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and deviations from coding best practices.

For this workflow, Q will:
1. Scan the project or a particular file you select and identify issues before code commit
2. Provide a list of findings from where you can follow up with Q to find solutions
3. Generate on-demand code fixes inline
