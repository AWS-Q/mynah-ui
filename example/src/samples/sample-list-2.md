This is a list below with some code and bolds inside

- **Bold** Text with some `inline code`.
- Also with some code blocks ```const a = 5;```

End of the list.

Certainly, here's an example of a Markdown list where each item has a bold text word:

* **Item1** This is the first list item.
* **Item2** This is the second list item.
* **Item3** This is the third list item.
* **Item4** This is the fourth list item. And it also has a [LINK](#) inside.

List with numbers.
1. **Item1** This is the first list item.
2. **Item2** This is the second list item.
3. **Item3** This is the third list item.
4. **Item4** This is the fourth list item. And it also has a [LINK](#) inside.
